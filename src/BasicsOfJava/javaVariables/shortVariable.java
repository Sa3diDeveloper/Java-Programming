//short: The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer.
// It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive).
// As with byte , the same guidelines apply: you can use a short to save memory in large arrays,
// in situations where the memory savings actually matters.

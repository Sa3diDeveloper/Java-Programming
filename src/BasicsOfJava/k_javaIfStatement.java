/*Java Conditions and If Statements
You already know that Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
Equal to a == b
Not Equal to: a != b
You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

Java has the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed*/

        int y = 18;
        if (x > y) {
            System.out.println("x is greater than y");
        }


        //example 2
        int time = 20;
        if (time < 18) {
            System.out.println("Good day.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Good evening.");
        }

        //example 3
        if (time < 10) {
            System.out.println("Good morning.");
        } else if (time < 18) {
            System.out.println("Good day.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Good evening.");
        }
    }

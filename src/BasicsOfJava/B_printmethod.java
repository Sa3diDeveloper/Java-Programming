// The Print() Method
// There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().

// The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:
public class B_printmethod {
    public  static  void  main(String args[]){
        System.out.print("Hi 1");
        System.out.println("Hi 2");
    }
}
